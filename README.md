# Todo CLI
A tool to maintain a to-do checklist from your terminal. I actually use this at work!

## Install
- Clone the git repo
- Make sure you have `go` installed
- Run `go install`
- Run `todo help` to see if it worked! (no semantic versioning yet)

## Update
- Run `git pull`
- Run `go install`
- You should now be on the latest version
